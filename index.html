    <p1 id="p1" class="p1" >For those who don't know, Berserk is a manga that was created in 1989 by the late Kentaro Miura in Japan. The story follows our protagonist Guts on a journey riddled with tragedy, violence, love, and betrayal.
        I think that Guts is probably one of, if not, the most complex and complete character in fiction. A large part of that is due to the fact that his story has been going on for over thirty years but its the way his character has evolved
        during that time that makes him so remarkable.
